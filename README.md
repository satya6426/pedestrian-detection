# pedestrian-detection
Pedestrian detection is an essential and significant task in any intelligent video surveillance system, as it provides the fundamental information for semantic understanding of the video footages.
Pedestrian detection is the cornerstone of many vision based applications, starting from object tracking to video surveillance and more recently, autonomous driving. With the rapid development of deep learning in object detection, pedestrian detection has achieved very good performance in traditional single-dataset training and evaluation setting.
